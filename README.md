# Repository for Advent of Code 2023 Solutions in C90

Tis the season for the Advent of Code, I'll be posting my solutions here for
each day that I complete. My goal is to complete each puzzle in ANSI C90 with
no external libraries. Each solution can be compiled with simply:
`gcc -ansi main.c`

Solutions are set up to take the input file as their only command line 
argument:
`a.out input.txt`
